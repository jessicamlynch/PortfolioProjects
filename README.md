This was a really interesting project I completed to explore more about SQL and visualizing the data. I initially started using the IDE MySQL Workbench, but there was no good way to import the csv files. I switched to using DBeaver which finally imported everything I needed and gave me the opportunity to play around with the entire dataset. I'm hoping to expand upon this project with more queries as I learn more SQL. I also loved discovering new ways to display the data using Tableau and hope to create more graphs for this dataset, specifically data involving vaccinations. Covid has impacted nearly every person in the world and sometimes understanding the tragedy we are going through is a great way to come to terms with just how far from the norm we are. Seeing the vaccination data visualized has reminded me that though there is a light at the end of the tunnel, there is still so much ahead.
